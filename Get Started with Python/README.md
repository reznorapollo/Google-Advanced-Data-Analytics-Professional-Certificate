## Modules Overview
### Module 1: Hello, Python!
In this introductory module, you'll explore the basics of Python programming and understand why Python is a powerful tool for data analysis. You’ll start with Jupyter Notebooks, an interactive coding environment, and learn how to use variables and data types to store and organize your data. You’ll also begin practicing essential coding skills.

### Module 2: Functions and Conditional Statements
This module introduces you to functions and conditional statements. You'll learn how to call functions to perform actions on your data and how to write conditional statements that guide the computer's decision-making based on your instructions. You'll also practice writing clean and reusable code that is easily understood by other data professionals.

### Module 3: Loops and Strings
In this module, you’ll learn about loops, which allow you to automate repetitive tasks, as well as how to manipulate strings using techniques such as slicing, indexing, and formatting. This foundational knowledge will enable you to write more efficient and dynamic code.

### Module 4: Data Structures in Python
You’ll dive into Python’s core data structures, including lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and arrays. This module also covers two critical Python libraries used for advanced data analysis: NumPy and pandas, which provide powerful tools for handling numerical data and large datasets.

### Module 5: End-of-Course Project
At the end of the course, you will apply everything you’ve learned by completing an end-of-course project. By choosing a business problem from a list of options and use the provided data to solve it.
