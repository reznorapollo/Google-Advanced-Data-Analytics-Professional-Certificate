## Modules Overview

### Module 1: Find and Share Stories Using Data
In this module, you will learn how to identify trends and stories hidden in datasets through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning. You’ll discover how cleaning data can help reveal insights and explore different ways to visualize your findings. Understanding your audience and choosing the right visualization techniques will be key to effectively communicating your results.

### Module 2: Explore Raw Data
When working with raw, unstructured data, it can be challenging to uncover meaningful stories. This module teaches you how to use Python to efficiently clean and structure data. You'll practice performing EDA techniques like discovery and structuring to understand the data better and identify important patterns.

### Module 3: Clean Your Data
Once you’ve explored the data, the next step is cleaning it for analysis. In this module, you’ll learn additional EDA practices, such as cleaning, joining, and validating datasets. You will gain hands-on experience using Python to clean, validate, and combine data, ensuring that it’s ready for analysis and visualization.

### Module 4: Data Visualizations and Presentations
Effective storytelling with data requires clear and professional visualizations. This module focuses on how to present your data insights in an ethical, accessible, and professional manner. You’ll learn to create impactful visualizations using Tableau, one of the most widely used data visualization tools, and explore advanced techniques for presenting your findings.

### Module 5: End-of-Course Project
In the final module, you’ll apply what you’ve learned by completing an end-of-course project. You will choose a business challenge and use the provided dataset to conduct EDA, clean the data, and create visualizations. This project will allow you to demonstrate your skills in data analysis and visualization, and the work you do will be essential for building your portfolio as a future data analyst.
