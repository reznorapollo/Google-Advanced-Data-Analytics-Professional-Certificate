### Regression Analysis: Simplify Complex Data Relationships

Course 5 of 7 in the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate

This course centers on regression analysis, a crucial skill for data professionals to identify connections between variables and understand the factors that impact business performance. Learners explore a variety of data modeling techniques and their practical use in addressing business problems, including linear regression, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and logistic regression. Under the guidance of Google experts who are actively working in the field, participants engage in hands-on exercises, real-world case studies, and practical tasks designed to sharpen their data analysis skills. By the end of the course, learners will be proficient in using predictive models to explain relationships between variables, gain insights into multiple regression, perform and interpret ANOVA tests, and build a range of logistic regression models, such as binomial, multinomial, ordinal, and Poisson log-linear regression models.

## Modules Overview
### Module 1: Introduction to Complex Data Relationships
In this module, you'll examine how the PACE framework serves as a foundation for regression analysis. You will learn about linear and logistic regression, understanding their similarities, differences, and when to apply each technique. Using real-world data, you will practice applying estimation techniques in Python and explore additional use cases for regression analysis.

### Module 2: Simple Linear Regression
You will delve into ordinary least squares estimation in Python and learn the four main assumptions of simple linear regression: linearity, normality of residuals, independent observations, and homoscedasticity. You'll build a regression model, evaluate its fit using R-squared, holdout samples, and measures of uncertainty like confidence intervals and p-values. The module also focuses on crafting a story using data and visualizing regression results with Python.

### Module 3: Multiple Linear Regression
Building on simple linear regression, this module extends concepts to multiple regression. You'll learn how to test assumptions using mathematics, built-in Python functions, and visualizations during the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process. You will interpret and evaluate multiple regression results and understand the concept of overfitting. Techniques like regularization will be explored to mitigate overfitting.

### Module 4: Advanced Hypothesis Testing
In this section, you’ll deepen your understanding of hypothesis testing by exploring tests such as Chi-squared, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and more advanced methods like ANCOVA, MANOVA, and MANCOVA. You will examine null and alternative hypotheses and learn how they shape the interpretation of your results.

### Module 5: Logistic Regression
This module focuses on logistic regression, especially binomial logistic regression, where data is classified into two categories. You will also build multinomial, ordinal, and log-linear Poisson regression models. Additionally, you will learn to evaluate classification models using metrics like ROC, AUC, precision, recall, and Type I/Type II errors.

### Module 6: End-of-Course Project
In the final module, you will complete an end-of-course project that synthesizes everything you've learned. You’ll apply regression techniques to analyze a workplace scenario dataset and solve a business problem, allowing you to showcase your new skills and build a portfolio-ready project. This project will demonstrate your capability to use regression models and hypothesis testing in practical, real-world data analysis.
